      simulator the code is unstable at T2. The optimisation seems ok but
      cutAndPlot looks wrong. We decided to completely remove the cutting in
      simulatorT1 and TN and to do the cut inside the simulatorT1/TN R code again. 
      This is a bit slower but at least the code is then as in 1.4.0

      was returned (bug report 167)

* 1.5.4
    * remove cutAndPlotResultsT2 function (use TN version instead)
    * speed up code by factor 2 in the T1 boolean case by sending matrices instead

      instead of new CNOlist class.
    * prep4sim returns an extra field in the list (maxinput)
    * gaBinaryT1 convert the iput CNOlist to an instance of CNOlist right at the top
      so that it is not done N times within the GA algorithm itself. Speeds up things
      by 3 times.

* 1.3.32
    * simulatorT1 and TN have additional check for AND gates with any NA inputs (see
      comments line 261 i nTN and 234 in 234)

      bString and this convention is used throughout the code (e.g., bStringT1 not
      bitStringT1) simlist and indexlist are now optional are after the bString
      argument.
    * indexList and simList are removed from the arguments and recomputede within
      all functions. It may be slower but this is negligeable compared to the
      simplification provided to the users. However, for back compatibilty these 2
      arguments are usually kept and set to NULL.
    * computeScoreT2 is now deprecated and computeScoreTN should be use instead.

    * Updated Rd files where needed

* 14/Nov/2011
    *     Update version to 0.99.8
    *     in the writeNetwork function: I made an escape solution for cases where the

          about this.  As many warnings as unmapped paths will be printed. This is what I
          added::

                            rOut<-NA
    
                            }

                    }
                #if the path could be mapped, we record the mapping
                if(!is.na(rIn) && !is.na(rOut)){

                    OrigMap[rIn]<-max(OrigMap[rIn],adj[i,3])
                    OrigMap[rOut]<-max(OrigMap[rOut],adj[i,3])
                # if the path couldn't be mapped (path too long), we print a warning, nad OrigMap
            # stays 0
                }else{

        	if(verbose == TRUE){
            		print("Please be aware that when mapping the scaffold network back to the PKN, compressed paths of length > 2 are ignored.")
        	    }

                    }

- fix a bug in writeReport: when the files are copied to the results directory,
  it now doesn't try to copy NAs anymore (the NAs are the names of files relating
  to time 2 optim.)

- it changes the version number so that it is according to Bioconductor
  guidelines: this number will be pushed to 1.0.0 automatically once the package
  is released

- it changes the installation instructions in the vignette (this will need to be
  changed again once accepted into Bioconductor)

- all the code chances in the vignette are now named

- all the code lines in the vignette have been reformatted to be under 80
  characters in length

- in the vignette, the DREAM example was changed from a full example to a briefly
  outlined one, the code being the same as above, just changing the name of
  variables (this also avoids having too many chunks of code tagged as eval=FALSE)

- fig 4 of vignette: file size reduction

- in the vignette, all the code is now tagged as eval=TRUE, except the
  installation one.  This is done by now evaluating even the bits of code that
  produce a file or directory, but then erasing these afterwards

- help files: all the code is not tagged as \dontrun{} anymore

- some man pages examples were shortened, wherever possible

- in help pages: code lines reformatted to not exceed 80 characters; code layout
  made more aerated

- in R code: code lines reformatted to not exceed 80 characters; code layout made
  more aerated

- fixes a bug in readMIDAS that was asked by reviewer who had a problem with the
  line is.nan(data) ->  it wasn't working for him, but anyway I don't think it was
  doing what I wanted because I wanted this line to look for the character "NaN"
  which is the Matlab equivalent of "NA" in R. Apparently in the reviewers dev
  (unstable) version of R, is.nan does not work on data.frames (which is what
  'data' is at this point in the function).

- makes the building faster compared to 0.99.3 by shortening some of the help
  files: CellNOptR-package, CNORwrap, cutAndPlotResultsT1, gaBinaryT1, plotFit,
  writeDot, writeNetwork, writeScaffold; and the CNORwrap part in the vignette
  (essentially all this involves mainly changing the parameters of the
  optimisation so that the optimisation does not explore so many solutions).

-fixes a bug in plotCNOlist and plotCNOlistLarge::

    if(c != 1 && r!=1 && r!=dim(CNOlist$valueSignals[[1]])[1] &&
                c != dim(CNOlist$valueSignals[[1]])[1]+1)

should be::

    if(c != 1 && r!=1 && r!=dim(CNOlist$valueSignals[[1]])[1] &&
                c != dim(CNOlist$valueSignals[[1]])[2]+1)

-fixes the same bug as above in plotOptimResults::

    if(c != 1 && r!=1 && r!=dim(expResults[[1]])[1] && c != dim(expResults[[1]])[1]+1)


should be::

    if(c != 1 && r!=1 && r!=dim(expResults[[1]])[1] && c != dim(expResults[[1]])[2]+1)


- plotOptimResults and plotCNOList/plotCNOlistLarge: Cor's email Oct 13th: some
  of the code could be simplified: the code has been dramatically shortened,
  rendering the above modification useless…  In the plotting section, instead of
  going through every possible combination or row and column index, I now do the
  plot and then add the x axis (if bottom row) and the y axis (if first column)

- functions writeNetwork, writeScaffold, writeDot: simplify, make different
  functions for the computing of weights and stuff and for the writing of the
  network

- function writeScaffold: the global function is still called writeScaffold and
  still needs the same arguments (ModelComprExpanded, optimResT1, optimResT2,
  ModelOriginal=ToyModel, CNOlist), but it is divided into:

    - a function writeScaffoldW that does the actual writing to files,
    - a function that gets the info for the sif file,
    - and a function that gets the additional info for the dot file.

  .. warning::only the writeScaffold function is imported in the namespace-> it is the only
        one with a help, the other function are hidden inside. if somebody wants
        to get the cytoscape info without writing it to a file they need to do::

        	sif<-getSifInfo(ModelComprExpanded=ModelComprExpanded,
              optimResT1=optimResT1,
              optimResT2=optimResT2,
              ModelOriginal=ModelOriginal,
              CNOlist=CNOlist)

    where the arguments are the same as those originally used for the
    writeScaffold function then the sif file is actually sif$sifFile[,1:3], and
    the attributes are  sif$EAweights and sif$EApresent

- there was a typo in "writeScaffold" that meant that the dot file was called
  ModelModelComprExpandedScaffold.dot instead of ModelComprExpandedScaffold.dot ->
  I corrected this but this means that I had to correct the argument namesFiles of
  writeReport in the vignette and in the CNORwrap function (to keep in mind when
  testing the package on old test scripts).


-   function writeNetwork: the global function is still called writeNetwork and
    still needs the same arguments (ModelComprExpanded, optimResT1, optimResT2,
    ModelOriginal, CNOlist), but it is divided into:

    - a function writeSNetworkW that does the actual writing to files,
    - a function that gets the info for the sif and dot files

    .. warning:: only the writeNetwork function is imported in the namespace->
        it is the only   one with a help, the other function are hidden inside. if
        somebody wants to get the cytoscape info without writing it to a file They
        need to do::

        	nwInfo<-getNetworkInfo(
        		ModelOriginal=ModelOriginal,
        		ModelComprExpanded=ModelComprExpanded,
        		optimResT1=optimResT1,
        		optimResT2=optimResT2,
        		CNOlist=CNOlist)


    where the arguments are the same as those originally used for the
    writeScaffold function  then the sif file is actually nwInfo$sifFile[,1:3],
    and the attributes are  nwInfo$EAweaights and nwInfo$nodesAttr

-   function writeNetwork: the nodes that were neither inh/stim/sig nor NCNO did
    not end up in the cytoscape node attribute file so I added a couple of lines of
    code that put them in.

- naming consistency:

        - GetFit -> getFit
        - ResidualError-> residualError
        - SimulateT1 -> simulateT1

    - change in the functions
    - change the function files names
    - change the helps and their file names
    - change the namespace
    - change the scripts and the vignette
    - change in the functions that use those:CNORwrap, simulatorT1, gaBinaryT1

    .. warning:: careful when adding the T2 back

- readMIDAS can now handle a DA:ALL column.  This has required quite some change
  in the code of the function, but that shouldn't change anything for the rest of
  the package since the output of the function is strictly the same.  What the
  function does if the number of DA and DV columns are different, and if this is
  because the only DA column is a DA:ALL column, is that the function creates all
  of the DA:xyz columns, so that in the end the output of readMIDAS is exactly the
  same whether DA:ALL was used or not.

- readSif: the big for loop of point 2 (for(i in 1:length(AndNodes)))  and the
  internal for loop at point 5b (for(n in 2:length(output))) used to both use the
  index i.  That is now changed.

- normalizeCNOlist: I put a warning in the help file that there shouldn't be
  zeros in the data (either NA or some low number, 0 is pretty unlikely as a
  biochemical measurement).

- writeScaffold: I changed the names of the files produced because it caused
  problems with the new version that works with multiple functions.  I also had to
  change the names in the CNORwrap function and in the vignette.  Same for
  writeNetwork.

- in the makeCNOlist: I added a bit that averages across replicate conditions if
  they exist.  I added a note about that in the help.

.. todo:: 
    - make the "Large" equivalent to "plotOptimResults" (see plotCNOlistLarge)
    - when replicates are available, add a section in the CNOlist that would hold
      the	standard deviation of each summarised measurement (only when replicates are
      available for all conditions and time points).
    - make the function makeCNOlist more flexible and robust?
